abstract = "A fundamental problem in neural network research, as well as in many other disciplines, is finding a suitable representation of multivariate data, i.e. random vectors. For reasons of computational and conceptual simplicity, the representation is often sought as a linear transformation of the original data. In other words, each component of the representation is a linear combination of the original variables. Well-known linear transformation methods include principal component analysis, factor analysis, and projection pursuit. Independent component analysis (ICA) is a recently developed method in which the goal is to find a linear representation of non-Gaussian data so that the components are statistically independent, or as independent as possible. Such a representation seems to capture the essential structure of the data in many applications, including feature extraction and signal separation. In this paper, we present the basic theory and applications of ICA, and our recent work on the subject."

abstract = {The blind source separation problem is to extract the underlying source signals from a set of linear mixtures, where the mixing matrix is unknown. This situation is common in acoustics, radio, medical signal and image processing, hyperspectral imaging, and other areas. We suggest a two-stage separation process: a priori selection of a possibly overcomplete signal dictionary (for instance, a wavelet frame or a learned dictionary) in which the sources are assumed to be sparsely representable, followed by unmixing the sources by exploiting the their sparse representability. We consider the general case of more sources than mixtures, but also derive a more efficient algorithm in the case of a nonovercomplete dictionary and an equal numbers of sources and mixtures. Experiments with artificial signals and musical sounds demonstrate significantly better separation than other known techniques.},

abstract = {Over the last few years, the development of multichannel sensors motivated interest in methods for the coherent processing of multivariate data. Some specific issues have already been addressed as testified by the wide literature on the so-called blind source separation (BSS) problem. In this context, as clearly emphasized by previous work, it is fundamental that the sources to be retrieved present some quantitatively measurable diversity. Recently, sparsity and morphological diversity have emerged as a novel and effective source of diversity for BSS. Here, we give some new and essential insights into the use of sparsity in source separation, and we outline the essential role of morphological diversity as being a source of diversity or contrast between the sources. This paper introduces a new BSS method coined generalized morphological component analysis (GMCA) that takes advantages of both morphological diversity and sparsity, using recent sparse overcomplete or redundant signal representations. GMCA is a fast and efficient BSS method. We present arguments and a discussion supporting the convergence of the GMCA algorithm. Numerical results in multivariate image and signal processing are given illustrating the good performance of GMCA and its robustness to noise.},

abstract = {This letter describes a new method for blind source separation, adapted to the case of sources having different morphologies. We show that such morphological diversity leads to a new and very efficient separation method, even in the presence of noise. The algorithm, coined multichannel morphological component analysis (MMCA), is an extension of the morphological component analysis (MCA) method. The latter takes advantage of the sparse representation of structured data in large overcomplete dictionaries to separate features in the data based on their morphology. MCA has been shown to be an efficient technique in such problems as separating an image into texture and piecewise smooth parts or for inpainting applications. The proposed extension, MMCA, extends the above for multichannel data, achieving a better source separation in those circumstances. Furthermore, the new algorithm can efficiently achieve good separation in a noisy context where standard independent component analysis methods fail. The efficiency of the proposed scheme is confirmed in numerical experiments},

abstract = {We address the problem of recovering a scene recorded through a semireflecting medium (i.e. planar lens), with a virtual reflected image being superimposed on the image of the scene transmitted through the semirefelecting lens. Recent studies propose imaging through a linear polarizer at several orientations to estimate the reflected and the transmitted components in the scene. In this study we extend the sparse ICA (SPICA) technique and apply it to the problem of separating the image of the scene without having any a priori knowledge about its structure or statistics. Recent novel advances in the SPICA approach are discussed. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methods.© 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

@article{OjaE2000Icaf,
abstract = {The recent work in the author's research group on using independent component analysis (ICA) for the analysis and prediction of financial time series is reviewed. ICA belongs to the group of linear transform methods, with the goal to make a transform from the observed signals into a signal space in which the signals are statistically independent. Sometimes independence can be attained, especially in blind source separation in which the observed signals are assumed to be linear mixtures of independent source components. Then the goal of ICA is to invert the unknown mixing operation. Even when independence is not possible, as is often the case in financial time series, the ICA transformation produces useful component signals whose dependence is reduced, and that are nonGaussian with a density allowing sparse coding. The ICA transformation is also related to the temporal structure of the found signals as measured by Kolmogorov complexity or its approximations. The signals are structured and hence may be easier to interpret and predict. After discussing the ICA criterion within the context of linear signal transforms, the FastICA algorithm is reviewed. It is a computationally efficient method for finding a subset or all of the component signals. Then, two financial applications are covered: decomposition of parallel financial time series of weekly sales into basic factors, and prediction of mixture time series by linear combinations of predictions on the ICA components.},

This algorithm is a direct extension of a recently developed sparse-representation-based image decomposition method called MCA (morphological component analysis), designed for the separation of linearly combined texture and cartoon layers in a given image (see [J.-L. Starck, M. Elad, D.L. Donoho, Image decomposition via the combination of sparse representations and a variational approach, IEEE Trans. Image Process. (2004), in press] and [J.-L. Starck, M. Elad, D.L. Donoho, Redundant multiscale transforms and their application for morphological component analysis, Adv. Imag. Electron Phys. (2004) 132]). In this extension, missing pixels fit naturally into the separation framework, producing separate layers as a by-product of the inpainting process. As opposed to the inpainting system proposed by Bertalmio et al., where image decomposition and filling-in stages were separated as two blocks in an overall system, the new approach considers separation, hole-filling, and denoising as one unified task. We demonstrate the performance of the new approach via several examples."

abstract = "A block-based approach coupled with adaptive dictionary learning is presented for underdetermined blind speech separation. The proposed algorithm, derived as a multi-stage method, is established by reformulating the underdetermined blind source separation problem as a sparse coding problem. First, the mixing matrix is estimated in the transform domain by a clustering algorithm. Then a dictionary is learned by an adaptive learning algorithm for which three algorithms have been tested, including the simultaneous codeword optimization (SimCO) technique that we have proposed recently. Using the estimated mixing matrix and the learned dictionary, the sources are recovered from the blocked mixtures by a signal recovery approach. The separated source components from all the blocks are concatenated to reconstruct the whole signal. The block-based operation has the advantage of improving considerably the computational efficiency of the source recovery process without degrading its separation performance. Numerical experiments are provided to show the competitive separation performance of the proposed algorithm, as compared with the state-of-the-art approaches. Using mutual coherence and sparsity index, the performance of a variety of dictionaries that are applied in underdetermined speech separation is compared and analyzed, such as the dictionaries learned from speech mixtures and ground truth speech sources, as well as those predefined by mathematical transforms such as discrete cosine transform (DCT) and short time Fourier transform (STFT)."

abstract = {This paper describes two digital implementations of a new mathematical transform, namely, the second generation curvelet transform in two and three dimensions. The first digital transformation is based on unequally spaced fast Fourier transforms, while the second is based on the wrapping of specially selected Fourier samples. The two implementations essentially differ by the choice of spatial grid used to translate curvelets at each scale and angle. Both digital transformations return a table of digital curvelet coefficients indexed by a scale parameter, an orientation parameter, and a spatial location parameter. And both implementations are fast in the sense that they run in O(n^2 \log n) flops for n by n Cartesian arrays; in addition, they are also invertible, with rapid inversion algorithms of about the same complexity. Our digital transformations improve upon earlier implementationsbased upon the first generation of curveletsin the sense that they are conceptually simpler, faster, and far less redundant. The software CurveLab, which implements both transforms presented in this paper, is available at http://www.curvelet.org.},

Yet, when the signals per se do not satisfy this assumption, sparsity can still be achieved by realizing the separation in a sparser transformed domain. The approach is illustrated here for M=2. In this case we estimate both the number of sources and the mixing matrix by the maxima of a potential function along the circle of unit length, and we obtain the minimal l1 norm representation of each data point by a linear combination of the pair of basis vectors that enclose it. Several experiments with music and speech signals show that their time-domain representation is not sparse enough. Yet, excellent results were obtained using their short-time Fourier transform, including the separation of up to six sources from two mixtures."

abstract="In this paper, a novel steganography of digital watermark scheme which contains digital watermark embedding and extraction processes is proposed. The proposed scheme is based on an iterative process of Arnold scrambling transform which is controlled by secret key shared by copyright owner and authorized users, and the extension of morphological component analysis theory which utilizes morphological diversity as the kernel role in blind source separation. Since both the original cover image and watermark are not needed for recovering received watermark, the proposed scheme can be categorized into blind watermarking technique. It is the most applicable watermarking technique due to the availability of the original cover image and watermark cannot be warranted in real-world applications. The proposed scheme overcomes the problem of too narrow hidden data bandwidth in traditional Least-Significant-Bit (LSB) replacement or LSB matching schemes. Instead of only hiding limited bits is allowed, we can embed a meaningful picture into the cover image by applying proposed scheme. Compared with classic Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) steganography schemes, the proposed steganography scheme has much higher embedding capacity and broader applicability scope. Images acquired in steganography experiments and the analysis of experimental results both prove the effectiveness of proposed scheme. Both subjective visual effect and objective quantitative results of the Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) index, Structural Similarity (SSIM) index and Normalized Correlation (NC) index confirm its brilliant steganography capability as well as its fine robustness to different noise attacks through communication channel.",

abstract = "It has previously been suggested that neurons with line and edge selectivities found in primary visual cortex of cats and monkeys form a sparse, distributed representation of natural scenes, and it has been reasoned that such responses should emerge from an unsupervised learning algorithm that attempts to find a factorial code of independent visual features. We show here that a new unsupervised learning algorithm based on information maximization, a nonlinear “infomax” network, when applied to an ensemble of natural scenes produces sets of visual filters that are localized and oriented. Some of these filters are Gabor-like and resemble those produced by the sparseness-maximization network. In addition, the outputs of these filters are as independent as possible, since this infomax network performs Independent Components Analysis or ICA, for sparse (super-gaussian) component distributions. We compare the resulting ICA filters and their associated basis functions, with other decorrelating filters produced by Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and zero-phase whitening filters (ZCA). The ICA filters have more sparsely distributed (kurtotic) outputs on natural scenes. They also resemble the receptive fields of simple cells in visual cortex, which suggests that these neurons form a natural, information-theoretic coordinate system for natural images."

abstract="A novel digital watermarking technique based on ICA image features is proposed in this paper. This new watermarking technique is provided for both high-quality visual imperceptibility and robust {\&} effective watermark detection. An adaptive-transform approach is employed in this technique, which is different from the conventional DCT or Wavelet transformations. The learned image-adaptive ICA features with localized, oriented and band-pass characters represent similar properties exhibited by the primary and secondary visual cortexes in human vision system (HVS). It enables a powerful masking effect to hide extra information into images with very little visual changes to human eyes. The embedding and detection of watermarks on ICA coefficients whose distribution is super-Gaussian in nature are found to be effective and robust even when only a classical spread-spectrum method is used. Additionally, the adaptive watermarking on suitable images and image regions is achieved implicitly owing to the merit that the ICA bases are automatically learnt from images. The experiments of the blind image watermarking system demonstrate its advantages on good image quality and robustness under various attacks such as image compression, geometric distortion and noises, in comparison with some conventional methods.",
