In addition, it is also worth noting that the SparseBSS model, using one dictionary to sparsely represent all the sources will get almost the same performance as using multiple but same-sized dictionaries when the dictionary redundancy d/n is large enough. As a result, it is reasonable to train only one dictionary for all the sources. An obvious advantage of using one dictionary is that the computational cost does not increase when the number of sources increases.\\
